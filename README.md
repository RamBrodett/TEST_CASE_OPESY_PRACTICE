Program Title: Merge Sort Practice
Author: Ram David M. Brodett
File Name: MERGE_SORT_PRAC.cpp
Entry Point: main() function located in MERGE_SORT_PRAC.cpp

Description:
-------------
This program demonstrates the implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm in C++.
It runs multiple test cases including random arrays, sorted arrays, reverse-sorted arrays,
arrays with duplicate values, and empty arrays to verify the correctness of the sort.

How to Compile:
----------------
Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., g++, clang++).
Then open a terminal in the directory containing the file and run:

    g++ -std=c++11 -o merge_sort_exec MERGE_SORT_PRAC.cpp

This will create an executable file named `merge_sort_exec`.

How to Run:
------------
After compilation, you can run the program using:

    ./merge_sort_exec     (on macOS/Linux)
    merge_sort_exec.exe   (on Windows, or just `merge_sort_exec` if using a terminal that supports it)

You should see the output of multiple test cases with arrays printed before and after sorting.
